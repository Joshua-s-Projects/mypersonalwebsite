## Joshua's Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio where I showcase an introduction of myself, my achievements, hobbies and work. I have included a feedback form where you'll be able to send a copy of your feedback directly to my email using Formspree, which will be greatly appreciated as it'll allow me to improve my webpage based on the given feedback.

## Frameworks
-HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language)

-CSS (Cascading Style-Sheets)

-Javascript

## Features
My webpage is highly focused on giving the ultimate best user experience. Various visual effects have been neatly incorporated into the webpage to provide smooth and seamless transitions. I used CSS Media Queries to resize my webpage according to the browser width, making it highly responsive on any device that you access my portfolio from.
